                We know stress isn’t good for our physical health. Research
                 has linked it with headaches, chronic inflammation, depression,
                  reduced immunity, asthma, digestive disorders, infectious disease,
                   cardiovascular disease, and cancer.<br><br>
                Science now tells us, however, that stress is just as bad for
                 our ability to be creative. In a late 1990s study, for instance,
                  researchers looked at the relationship between stress and 
                  creativity, and reported strong negative correlations.<br><br>
                The higher the stress level, the lower the creativity. <br><br>
                In a 2002 study, researchers analyzed more than 9,000 daily diary
                 entries from people who were working on projects that required
                 high levels of creativity. They found that stress, in the form 
                 of time pressure, resulted in less creative results.
