Research\n                 has linked it with headaches, chronic inflammation, depression,\n                  reduced immunity, asthma, digestive disorders, infectious disease,\n                   cardiovascular disease, and cancer.<br><br>\n                Science now tells us, however, that stress is just as bad for\n                 our ability to be creative. In a late 1990s study, for instance,\n                  researchers looked at the relationship between stress and \n                  creativity, and reported strong negative correlations.<br><br>\n                The higher the stress level, the lower the creativity. <br><br>\n                In a 2002 study, researchers analyzed more than 9,000 daily diary\n                 entries from people who were working on projects that required\n                 high levels of creativity. They found that stress, in the form \n                 of time pressure, resulted in less creative results.\n            </h4>\n            </div>\n    \n    <img class=\"main-img\" src=\"/0a9abf02247b3fed9966a2b29aaac86c.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; background: black;\"> \n\n    </div>\n\n    <h4 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 82, 87); margin-left: 10%;\">• Nature can enhance creative ways of thinking.<br><br>\n    • Nature helps with recharging directed-attention needed when developing ideas.<br><br>\n    • Nature especially plays a role in the Preparation phase and the Incubation phase of the creative process.<br><br>\n    • The Perceived Restorative Dimensions ‘Nature’, ‘Space’ and ‘Serene’ are important for the creative professionals.<br><br></h4>\n\n    <div class=\"home-button\">\n        <a href=\"/5b8d0da3cd1f25f5d412f2a2c8f605b7.html\"><button class=\"submit gen-buttons\">Go to our Packages</button></a>\n\n    </div>\n<br>\n</body>\n<footer>\n    <p>This website was made by Sebastian Barckhahn, founder of TechLodge Inc.</p>\n</footer>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"3f08a92202bd11e2eb6c621f294db842","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
